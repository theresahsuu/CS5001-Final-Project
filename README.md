# CS5001 Final Project - Guess the Number Game

This is a Python program for "Guess the Number" game. The project allows a player to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100, with hints given after the second try. In addition, the project includes a computer player mode that uses a binary search algorithm to guess the number within the minimum number of tries. 

Getting Started:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Run guess_the_number_game.py using Python 3. 
3. Follow the prompts to play the game or have the computer player guess the number. 

Key Aspects:
- Uses the random module to generate a random number between 1 and 100.
- Implements a loop that continues until the player or computer guesses the correct number.
- Provides hints to the player or computer after the second guess by updating the guessing range.
- Includes input validation to ensure the user's guess is within the valid range.
- Allows the user to choose between playing the game themselves or having the computer play.

Class:
- This project was created for the CS 5001 course at Northeastern University, which is an introduction to programming using Python.

Dependencies:
- Python 3 

Future Work:
- Implement additional difficulty levels
- Add a time limit for guesses
- Allow user to input their own range of numbers 

Credits - This project was created by Theresa. 

Enjoy!
